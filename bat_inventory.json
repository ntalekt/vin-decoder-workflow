Having been a 993 owner for more than 25 years, I recall when the community of owners was all about DRIVING, enjoying, modifying and yes repairing when things broke/failed/leaked. Sadly, this culture has shifted more to a drive to Cars and Coffee and talk about our “investment” crowd; but please prove to me that that old vibe still exists… If you are of that vibe, please check out this 993!In full transparency, even though I am regarded as a subject matter expert on the Porsche market, this one leaves me scratching my head as to what it is worth, so I will let the market decide! I am running it NO RESERVE, I am a SELLER not an advertiser nor a dreamer. This should be a fun week! A few initial thoughts:I strive to be an engaged, knowledgeable, and transparent seller.

The engine screams with a beautiful tone, it loves long high revs. Car is bulletproof as long as IMS is done (or at least has been in my case). The whole package feels very lightweight, tossable, and extremely analog. The German tightness is fairly crazy, from the pedal box to the springs. These things will still be great at 100,000 miles, yet many have low mileage like this one because they were allocated thus bought as third+ cars, not second cars.CancelYour changes are being saved.This comment's likes:2This comment's likes:2This comment's likes:2Flag as not constructiveFlag as not constructiveFlagged as not constructive — Thanks.Edit",

And, this one is the same, which I confirmed in person and got to meet a very helpful and gracious man who cared for this car since seeing it on the showroom floor.  It has an interesting provenance relating to Mr. Bob Ingram, a noted collector.  I believe these cars have been somewhat overlooked,,,,, until recently, and in person, they are spectacular to look at and a joy to drive.  I believe they are solid collectible 911s and will continue to be, as the final naturally aspirated of their kind, for years to come.

I’ve seen sometimes aftermarket screws added when people add RS brake ducts and need to run the hoses …Cool the original 16” cups accompany the sale!CancelYour changes are being saved.This comment's likes:0This com",

I am not an expert in these cars, but I’ve seen enough on those I’ve owned and others to know where to look. It’s a safe rule that, despite being galvanized, these cars are all rusting if you know where to look. All of them. The only real rust free examples are cars that have been disassembled in a quest to locate and eliminate corrosion, the rest will have it in some places, yes even if it’s a CA car. It’s even harder because Porsche adhesives look exactly like rust, so it’s hard to differentiate in photos.Some of this is due to age, a lot is due to design flaws and the lack of plastic shielding around the wheel wells that most modern cars have. They fling dirt, debris, and moisture up into bad places where it sits and corrodes over time. You will be hard pressed to find any 911 of this era or earlier that isn’t rusting somewhere, you ",

What I love about this car is that it’s one you can invest in, drive, and enjoy without worrying about hurting its value. You can put miles on it, and it will still hold strong and appreciate with the market. Unlike a super low-mile car, where driving it immediately depreciates it, this one is meant to be enjoyed. 930s are really the epitome of an era in automotive history.CancelYour changes are being saved.This comment's likes:6This comment's likes:6This comment's likes:6Flag as not constructiveFlag as not constructiveFlagged as not constructive — Thanks.Edit",

People aren’t paying 7 figures for a Singer because of the carbon.Your thoughts remind me of the watch collectors who constantly argue that other brands have better finish and value than Rolex, yet Rolex has the biggest following.Stop trying to make dollars and “cents” of it.

A 2021 mechanical service performed by Porsche in Stuttgart totaled over €37,000 (~$43k) and included an overhaul of the six-speed manual transaxle along with a refresh of the engine, ignition system, chassis, and air conditioning system. Finished in black over black leather, the car is powered by a 3.8-liter M64/20 flat-six and features a seam-welded body shell, an aluminum hood, front and rear spoilers, cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes with red-painted calipers, adjustable anti-roll bars, a front strut tower bar, staggered-width 18″ Speedline multi-piece wheels, sport seats, and a cassette player. It was imported to the US in 2023 and was purchased by its current owner in 2024. This Carrera RS is now offered in Monterey, California on dealer consignment as part of the Mohr Import",
