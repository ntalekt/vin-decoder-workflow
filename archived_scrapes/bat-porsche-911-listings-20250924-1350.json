I initially thought the car was keyed but believe it happened when the technician was working on the car. I filed an insurance claim to have that corrected along with other paint imperfections around the car too include the lower side skirts as I did not like the GT2 side skirts – makes the car look bulky.

To most who are buying these hand built bespoke resto mods, the money doesn’t really matter. I also think you are overthinking the carbon factor. People aren’t paying 7 figures for a Singer because of the carbon.Your thoughts remind me of the watch collectors who constantly argue that other brands have better finish and value than Rolex, yet Rolex has the biggest following.Stop trying to make dollars and “cents” of it. It’s Porsche!CancelYour changes are being saved.This comment's likes:0This comment's likes:0This comment's likes:0Flag as not constructiveFlag as not constructiveFlagged as not constructive — Thanks.EditAug 13 at 4:28 AMfattychargedThis author's likes:376@RemingtonSR71nailed it…absolute nutteryCancelYour changes are b",
