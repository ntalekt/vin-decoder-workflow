Without one, the condition is uncertain. Bore scoring is not limited to low mileage or cold climate cars. High mileage M96 engines and those from warmer climates can also be affected.CancelYour changes are being saved.This comment's likes:4This comment's likes:4This comment's likes:4Flag as not constructiveFlag as not constructiveFlagged as not constructive — Thanks.EditAug 12 at 3:28 PMwmcnair (The Seller)This author's likes:307+-4+-4+-4+-4CancelYour changes are being saved.This comment's likes:0This comment's likes:0This comment's likes:0Flag as not cons",

I am not an expert in these cars, but I’ve seen enough on those I’ve owned and others to know where to look. It’s a safe rule that, despite being galvanized, these cars are all rusting if you know where to look. All of them. The only real rust free examples are cars that have been disassembled in a quest to locate and eliminate corrosion, the rest will have it in some places, yes even if it’s a CA car. It’s even harder because Porsche adhesives look exactly like rust, so it’s hard to differentiate in photos.Some of this is due to age, a lot is due to design flaws and the lack of plastic shielding around the wheel wells that most modern cars have. They fling dirt, debris, and moisture up into bad places where it sits and corrodes over time. You will be hard pressed to find any 911 of this era or earlier that isn’t rusting somewhere, you ",
